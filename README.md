# Password Creation Guidelines and Protection Measures

## Password Creation Guidelines
To ensure the security of your passwords, follow these guidelines:

- **Complexity**: Create passwords that are complex and difficult for others to guess.
- **Length**: Passwords should be a minimum of eight characters and include a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Avoid Common Combinations**: Exercise good judgment and avoid using basic combinations that may be easily guessed by others.
- **Unique Passwords**: Each account should have a unique password. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts or platforms.
- **Immediate Change**: If a password's security has been compromised, change it immediately.
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords every 90 days to enhance security.

## Ensuring Password Protection
To protect your passwords, consider the following measures:

- **Confidentiality**: Keep your passwords confidential and do not share them with anyone else.
- **Phishing Awareness**: Stay vigilant against phishing scams and other fraudulent attempts to steal corporate credentials. Regular training and refresher courses will be provided to enhance awareness.
- **Avoid Writing Down Passwords**: It is best to memorize passwords rather than writing them down where they could be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals.

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines and protection measures, you can significantly enhance the security of your passwords and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts and sensitive information.
